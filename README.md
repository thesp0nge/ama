In September 2019, I partecipated my [first
ama](https://www.reddit.com/r/ItalyInformatica/comments/d0d6ii/sono_paolo_perego_cybersecurity_expert_blogger_su/?sort=new)
and since I enjoyed a lot and since I received a lot of questions by email, I
decided to create this AMA place so all questions and answers can be read by
anyone.

Supported languages are Italian and English

### Guidelines

- Ensure your question hasn't already been answered.
- Use a succinct title and description.
- Bugs & feature requests should be opened on the relevant issue tracker.
- Support questions are better asked on Stack Overflow.
- Be civil and polite :)
